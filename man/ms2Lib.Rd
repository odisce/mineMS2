\usage{
ms2Lib(
  x,
  suppInfos = NULL,
  ids = NULL,
  intThreshold = NULL,
  infosFromFiles = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{May be one of the following
\itemize{
\item A character vector giving the path to a directory full of readable format.
\item A list of Spectrum2 objects which will be integrated directly.
\item A single .mgf file regrouping multiple spectra.
}}

\item{suppInfos}{Supplementary information to be associated to the spectra.
It should be of the same size as the number of spectra. If there is a "file" column, this
column is used to match the filenames. A "composition" or "formula" fields may also be present, and is then used to set the
formula of the molecules.}

\item{ids}{A supplementary vector giving a set of ids to design the spectra. It may be any character vector which
does not start with \code{'P', 'L', 'S'} as they are used internally by mineMS2. Alternatively if a suppInfos table is furnished
and if it contains an id fields, it will be used. If no ids are furnished, an id will be generated for each spectra in the form \code{'S1', 'S2', ..., 'SN'}
where N is the number of furnished spectra.}

\item{intThreshold}{The intensity threshold used to filter out the peaks.}

\item{infosFromFiles}{Shall the other informations present in the files be added to the supplementary infos.}
}
\description{
Create a ms2Lib object from files in the correct format. Eventually add some supplementary informations given in a csv file. 
This supplementary information may notably include the composition or the formula of the molecules.

\examples{
#We locate the example file
path_demo <- system.file("dataset",package="mineMS2")
path_mgf <- file.path(path_demo,"dda_msms_pverrucosum.mgf")

#Simple import
m2l <- ms2Lib(path_mgf)

#Import including some file formula
supp_infos_path <- file.path(path_demo,"dda_msms_pverrucosum_supp.csv")
supp_infos <- read.table(supp_infos_path,header=TRUE,sep=";")
m2l <- ms2Lib(path_mgf,suppInfos = supp_infos)
